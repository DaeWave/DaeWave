<h2 align="center"> About Me </h2>
<p align="center"> Just recently started my coding journey and only wish to become a good all-around full-stack developer!
I found myself coding small projects at first but then eventually decided to carry on one day finding myself at a coding Bootcamp **HyperionDev**. Since then I have forever been creating projects honing my skills to eventually become comfortable with multiple languages and creating projects that either created practical world examples or practising projects to have a better understanding of programming concepts.
